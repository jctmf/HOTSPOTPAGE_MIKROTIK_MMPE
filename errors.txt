# This file contains error messages which are shown to user, when http/https
# login is used.

# It should never happen. If it will, error page will be shown
# displaying this error message (error-orig will describe what has happened)

# config-error
# Should never happen if hotspot is configured properly.

config-error = Erro do servidor ($(error-orig))

# not-logged-in

# which actually is not logged in
